            <p class="blog-post-p">
                Are you a web developer tired of the endless search for free web hosting services online? Well, consider this the Holy Grail of free web hosting.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">
                In this guide, I’ll lead you through a plethora of free web hosting services, all of which I have personally tested on my own, covering front-end, back-end, and database technologies, while also highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">
                I’ll guide you through a series of options to deploy websites that use <span class="i">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Node, Flask, Django, PHP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB</span> and more.
            </p>

            <h5 class="blog-post-h5">GitHub Pages</h5>
            <img src="../pics/github-pages.png" alt="GitHub Pages Pic" class="blog-pic">

            <a href="https://pages.github.com/" class="blog-post-link" target="_blank">GitHub Pages Website</a>

            <p class="blog-post-p">
                If you just want to deploy simple static websites that only contain code in <span class="i">HTML, CSS, JavaScript</span> and other simple front-end libraries such as <span class="i">Bootstrap and jQuery</span>. You’ll find GitHub Pages to be the right fit for you.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">
                I have personally used it several times to deploy simple front-end exercises such as a <a href="https://josewebdev2000.github.io/El-Bandido/" target="_blank" class="blog-post-link decorated small-font">Responsive Fictitious Mexican Restaurant Landing Page</a>, <a href="https://josewebdev2000.github.io/Landing-Page/" target="_blank" class="blog-post-link decorated small-font">Desktop Photography Company Landing Page</a> and HTML5 games like <a href="https://josewebdev2000.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/" target="_blank" class="blog-post-link decorated small-font">Rock Paper Scissors</a> and an <a href="https://josewebdev2000.github.io/etch-a-sketch/" target="_blank" class="blog-post-link decorated small-font">Etch a Sketch App.</a>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">
                However, you cannot deploy your back-end using GitHub pages and you’re limited to the content you can deploy. Nonetheless, you may deploy your back-end somewhere else and communicate to it through <span class="i">AJAX</span> requests.
            </p>
            <h5 class="blog-post-h5">Pros</h5>
            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Website Speed</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">Your website will be quite fast which provides an awesome user experience.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Deployment Convenience</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">You mostly need to deploy your front-end code to GitHub and choose the branch that contains your website to deploy it.</p>

            <h5 class="blog-post-h5">Cons</h5>
            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Subdomain Limitation</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">You cannot choose the subdomain of your website. It will always be your GitHub username.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">No Customer Support</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">You are the only person who is responsible for the performance of your website. You’re the programmer, figure it out.</p>

            <h5 class="blog-post-h5">Netlify</h5>
            <img src="../pics/netlify.png" alt="Netlify Blog Pic" class="blog-pic">

            <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" class="blog-post-link" target="_blank">Netlify Website</a>

            <p class="blog-post-p">
                Netlify is a great website that allows you to deploy complex web applications that use modern web development libraries and frameworks such as <span class="i">React.js, Vue.js, Node.js, Next.js, etc.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">
                I have personally used it to deploy a <a href="https://main--adorable-twilight-b8e982.netlify.app/" target="_blank" class="blog-post-link decorated small-font">React App</a> I was building as part of a Udemy course.
            </p>
            <h5 class="blog-post-h5">Pros</h5>
            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Easy Deployment</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">All you need to deploy a front-end app to Netlify is to provide the GitHub repository of your app and go through the deployment steps.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Automatic Deployments</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">Your Netlify Web App will automatically deploy the most recent changes of your GitHub repository once it’s already been deployed.</p>

            <h5 class="blog-post-h5">Cons</h5>
            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Limited Hosting</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">The maximum number of websites you can deploy under Netlify’s free tier is 500. Beyond that you cannot deploy more websites.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Costly Resources</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">Even though you use the free-tier, Netlify still tracks the charge of certain features such as the build time of your website and bandwidth.</p>

            <h5 class="blog-post-h5">Render</h5>
            <img src="../pics/render.jpg" alt="Render Blog Pic" class="blog-pic">

            <a href="https://render.com/" class="blog-post-link" target="_blank">Render Website</a>

            <p class="blog-post-p">
                I think this is a fantastic service to use not only to deploy back-end services, but full-stack web applications as well. It contains built-in support for the most popular and modern web development technologies such as <span class="i">React, Node, Express, Flask, Django, Go, Ruby on Rails, and Laravel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">
                I have personally used render to deploy a news header website I developed on my own called <a href="https://josewebdev2000.github.io/News-Maximus-Front-End/" target="_blank" class="blog-post-link decorated small-font">News Maximus</a> built upon <span class="i">React and Node</span>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">
                However, in case your back-end stack is not natively supported you can still deploy your web application thanks to <span class="i">Docker</span> Most of the time all you need to do is to package your web application, create a <span class="i">Dockerfile</span> to describe it and Render will take care of the rest.
            </p>
            <h5 class="blog-post-h5">Pros</h5>
            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Service Diversity</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">You may deploy static websites, full-stack applications as web services, and even PostgreSQL and Redis remote database instances.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Easy Deployment</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">You need to connect your web app’s GitHub repository to Render and then go through the deployment steps which are simple to follow and provide logs in case any error arises during deployment.</p>

            <h5 class="blog-post-h5">Cons</h5>
            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Slow Rendering</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">According to the Render Documentation on their Free Tier. If your website remains inactive for 15 minutes or more, the next time you visit it the website will load way slower.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-p"><span class="i">Expiring Databases</span></p>
            <p class="blog-post-p">In case you chose to build a remote instance of a database, this instance will be destroyed after 3 months unless you upgrade the database instance.</p>
